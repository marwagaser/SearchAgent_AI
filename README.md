## Project Idea

There exists an nXm grid which contains *stones*, *warriors* (Thanos warriors), and *Thanos* (Enemy). Iron Man (player) tries to collect all the stones and kill Thanos by snapping his finger in the cell which Thanos exists in after collecting all the stones. On his way to collect stones and kill Thanos, he can kill warriors too. Therefore, a search agent was implemented to achieve that goal. 

The following search strategies were used by the AI search agent to find solutions to the problem

** 1- A* Search
2- Greedy Search
3- DFS
4- BFS
5- UCS
6- IDS **
